Dump questions of an OCAJP 8 Exam. Every question has a java file, run it separately. Eclipse Recommended

Hello
My name is Farhan Qasim

I've created some questions for JAVA OCAJP 8 Exams.
The questions are included in the java file.
Each java file has a main method which has the quetion inside it.
If for example we have questions which require multiple classes, they would be inside packages named as questions, for example q7 package.

Each file has a question. Answer the file in your mind or notepad before running it. Then run the file.

After running the file, the answer would be printed out.

I've tried my best to do it easily, i know it might have some mistakes.

I am also preparing for the exam, so it might help anyone who wants to give OCAJP 8 certification.
